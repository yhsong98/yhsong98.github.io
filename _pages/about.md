My name is Yuhan SONG. I was born in Anhui Province, China. I received my BEng in Information Security and MSc in Information Science in 2019 and 2023, respectively, from [Hefei University of Technology](https://en.hfut.edu.cn/) and [Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.jaist.ac.jp) (under the supervision of Professor [Nak Young Chong](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/robot/)). I am now pursuing my PhD at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) under the supervision of Professor [Kanako Harada](https://sites.google.com/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cdbim-medical-devices).

Research projects
======
1. <b>Multiarm Robotic Platform for Scientific Exploration</b><br>
<i>October 2024 - Present</i><br>
In UTokyo, I am participating in the development of multiarm robotic platform for biomedical usage, which is a part of [Moonshot Program Goal 3](https://www.jst.go.jp/moonshot/en/program/goal3/index.html). In the first stage, I plan to build a smart visual servoing system that should be capable of adjusting the camera postion and angle in a task agnoustic way.

1. <b>Robot-assisted Ultrasound Scan System</b><br>
<i>July 2023 - September 2024</i><br>
At intelligent robotics laboratory in JAIST, I was developing a robot arm based fully-automated [ultrasound scan system](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/robot/research/ultrasound/ultrasound.php). This project is a combination of advanced ultrasound image segmentation algorithms and new methods of symmetry-aware dense visual descriptor.

1. <b>Ultrasound Image Segmentation</b><br>
<i>April 2022 - March 2023</i><br>
I have proposed and implemented several original network models that can perform image segmentation targeting at multiple anatomical structures in abdominal ultrasound images.
