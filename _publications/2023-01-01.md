As recent advances in AI are causing the decline of conventional diagnostic methods, the realization of end-to-end diagnosis is fast approaching. Ultrasound image segmentation is an important step in the diagnostic process. An accurate and robust segmentation model accelerates the process and reduces the burden of sonographers. In contrast to previous research, we take two inherent features of ultrasound images into consideration: (1) different organs and tissues vary in spatial sizes, (2) the anatomical structures inside human body form a relatively constant spatial relationship. Based on those two ideas, we propose a new image segmentation model combining Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Spatial Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN). We discuss why we use FPN to extract anatomical structures of different scales and how SRNN is implemented to extract the spatial context features in abdominal ultrasound images.
